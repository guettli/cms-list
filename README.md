# CMS List

An opinionated list of open source CMS projects. Some headless (without a GUI), some with head.

# Types of CMSs

* normal: Wordpress, Django-CMS: Web-Interface to edit the data. 
* headless: You have a GUI to edit data, but it is up to you to display the data.
* Static Site Generators: The final output are HTML files which you can host very cheap. No database or processing is required if a user browses the pages.

For Static Site Generators I have an own list: [SSG List](https://github.com/guettli/static-site-generators)
